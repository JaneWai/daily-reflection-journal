## Step 5: Update Your Application

1. Open your project's `.env` file
2. Replace the placeholder with your actual Google Client ID:

```
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-client-id-from-google-cloud-console
```

For example:
```
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=123456789012-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

3. Save the file

## Step 6: Test Your Application

1. Start your application with `npm run dev`
2. Click the "Sign in with Google" button
3. You should see the Google sign-in popup
4. After signing in, you should be able to use Google Drive for storage

## Troubleshooting

### "Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch"
- Make sure the URL you're accessing your app from exactly matches one of the authorized JavaScript origins
- If using a different port, add that origin to your authorized JavaScript origins list

### "Error 403: access_denied"
- Check that you've enabled the correct APIs
- Verify that you've added the necessary scopes to your OAuth consent screen

### "Error: idpiframe_initialization_failed"
- This usually means there's an issue with your client ID
- Double-check that you've copied the correct client ID to your `.env` file
- Make sure your app is being served over HTTPS if accessing from a production domain

## Moving to Production

When you're ready to deploy your app to production:

1. Go back to the Google Cloud Console > APIs & Services > Credentials
2. Edit your OAuth client ID
3. Add your production domain to the authorized JavaScript origins
4. If your app is in production use, you may need to verify your app through the OAuth consent screen verification process

## Publishing Your OAuth App (Optional)

If you plan to make your app available to more than 100 users:

1. Go to "OAuth consent screen"
2. Add any required information (privacy policy URL, etc.)
3. Click "Submit for verification"
4. Google will review your app and approve it for public use

This process can take several days to complete.
